**In this site, we are using:**

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Github Pages**
* [Link to my project on Github Pages] (https://kaitbobait.github.io/web_project_4/ )

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

### To Do List:

**Cards**
* (DONE)create the 6 cards in JS - view project section on Practicum
* when a card is added, put to front of card section
* add a "delete" icon to each card
* make the "delete" button able to remove that card
* each picture in cards - when clicked, the picture will popup
* when picture is popped up, when closed, should exit the popup
* max-width of an opened pictures is 75vw, max height: 75vh;

**Add Card Form**
* copy the edit form structure for edit profile popup
* custom name and image
* save button adds card to page (submit event)
* opens when the + button is clicked, and closes when the close button is clicked

**Like button**
* (DONE)If user clicks "like button", the heart changes its color
* make it toggle (not a requirement, but good idea)

**Popups**
* make the popup opening and closing look smooth
