# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Description

* This is a site that you'll be able to edit your name and occupation. You will be able to add images and titles do the site, as well like "like" any photo.

### Technologies

**In this site, we are using:**

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* BEM methodology


### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mUgu8OSHWE0M6p6vfwmdu9/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Github Pages**
* [Link to my project on Github Pages] (https://kaitbobait.github.io/web_project_4/ )

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
